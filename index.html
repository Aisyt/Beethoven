            <div class="section-left">
                <p>Ludwig van Beethoven (December 16, 1770 to March 26, 1827) was a German pianist and composer widely considered the greatest of all time, whose innovative compositions combined vocals and instruments, widening the scope of sonata, symphony, concerto and quartet.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-right">
                <p>He is the crucial transitional figure connecting the Classical and Romantic ages of Western music. Beethoven’s personal life was marked by a struggle against deafness, and some of his most important works were composed during the last 10 years of his life, when he was quite unable to hear. He died at the age of 56.</p>

                        <p class="composition-p">The piece is basically in rondo form, ABACA. It is in A minor and in 3/8 time. It begins with an A minor theme marked Poco moto (in some motion), with the left hand playing arpeggios alternating between A minor and E major. The same motifs follow around C major and G major, before returning to the original theme. The B section in the submediant major of F major which concludes in 32nd note runs leading to a repeat of the A... section. In the D section, an.. agitated theme in the subdominant key of D minor is accompanied by repetitive chords on a pedal point, with some dramatic diminished seventh chords. This section concludes with an ascending A minor arpeggio followed by a chromatic descent over two octaves, leading to another repeat of the A section. While the A section is not difficult to play, the runs in the B section and the rapid rising figure in the C section require more pianistic skill. </p>
